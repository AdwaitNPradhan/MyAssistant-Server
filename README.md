# My Assistant Service [Main Server]

Plan is to make an assistant service just for fun, helping with tasks.
Yeah there are a lot of these out there but what harm there is to add one more. 😆

Dude if I can get some help with developing this, I would be happy.

## Things this thing should do (hopefully 🤣)

We have the basics here (ofc)

- [ ] Notes
- [x] Task List
- [ ] Reminders
- [ ] Time Tracking
- [ ] Expense Manager

## Technology (Server)

- Typescript (should I be listing this here? who knows)
- Fastify
- MongoDB
- RedisDB (if i can set it up the right way 😒)
- Docker or something for easy deployment. (setting up stuff can sometimes just be a hassle 🤷‍♂️)
- and more, idk interesting stuffs just keep popping up

## Developer Thoughts

> Am I spelling developing the right way? IDK don't have time to google LOL😆
> Hopefully I complete this project.
> Why make this? IDK maybe i will feel less useless spending time doing this rather than doing nothing
> Have renamed this project like more than 3 times. Decided on this one finally
