# Developers Assistant Service Main Server

Plan is to make a assistant service for developers with problems they face while developing and implement any <i>Toilet Seat/Shower</i> ideas to the product.

I might create a template for feature request on the issues tab some time soon.

Bro if I can get some help with developing this, I would be happy.

## Things this thing should do (hopefully 🤣)

We have the basics here (ofc)
- [ ] Notes
- [ ] Task List
- [ ] Reminders
- [ ] Time Tracking

And then the Specials
- [ ] Server Crash checker
- [ ] 

## Technology (Server)
- Typescript (should I be listing this here? who knows)
- Nest.JS (Why the classes though bro)
- MongoDB
- RedisDB (if i can set it up the right way 😒)
- Docker or something for easy deployment. (setting up stuff can sometimes just be a hassle 🤷‍♂️)
- and more, idk interesting stuffs just keep popping up

## Developer Thoughts
> Am I spelling developing the right way? IDK don't have time to google LOL😆
> Hopefully I complete this project.
> Why make this? IDK maybe i will feel less useless spending time doing this rather than doing nothing
> Have renamed this project like more than 3 times. Decided on this one finally
